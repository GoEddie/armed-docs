# WHAT IS ARMED?

Armed is an extension for vs code that helps write AZURE ARM templates.

Armed has a treeviewer similar to the arm tools fot visual studio except this viewer enumerates all the properties of a respurce instead of just the resources.

Armed's killer feature is the ability to test arm template functions locally so you can test any scripts in the templates *without* having to deploy them, _WoW_

## TODO:

Some functions like reference and listKeys are stubs they dont actually call the real function but I have implemented local versions of pretty much every other function.

## STUCK?

Raise an issue here if you get stuck and ill help you :)
